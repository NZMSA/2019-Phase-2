# [Why React + Typescript?](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-why-a-guide-to-using-typescript-with-react-fffb76c61614)

TypeScript is a free, open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language.

We will be using [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) maintained by Microsoft for phase 2 training.

# [API's?](https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=WSM14025USEN)

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the underpinning of the cloud, mobile, and Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. The speed, ease, and portability of data exchanged through APIs allow for all our modern innovations and conveniences. Everything from how we order taxis, move money between bank accounts, watch entertainment, share life moments through videos on our social media feeds, and manage or monitor our homes . . . it all happens because of APIs. APIs are connecting the world in ways that were previously unfathomable.
